# Web scraping
- the automated process of extracting data from websites
- involves using software to retrieve information from web pages, often in large quantities, and then structuring or storing that data for analysis or other purposes
- this process typically involves sending requests to web servers, parsing the HTML content, and extracting specific data points like text, images, or prices

### Is Web scraping Illegal
- It is important to know what the implications of web scraping, especially when you are selling that data as a part of a business
- if you are using the data privately for yourself then it does not matter, because you are just a user
- You cannot commercialise copyrighted content
    - setting up a business with someone elses data
    - Example: if you scraped video data from youtube, you cannot just use that video on your own website, the viedo is copyrighted by a Youtube user
    - this applies to a lot of theings like blog post, music etc...
- You cannot scrape data that is behind authentication
    - so if you have to log into a website in order to scrape the data that will be illegal
- Website you can access without logging in and the content is not something that can be copyrighted is fair game legally
    - websites with data that you access as is(without logging in)can not bind you because you have not aggreed to anything
- A lot of websites will use captcha or recaptcha in order to prevent bots like the python code to get data from their websites
    - just because it is legal does not mean you can do it
    - captcha or recaptcha are services that is used by websites to prevent people from scraping their data
    - when you agree to captcha or recaptcha it checks to see if you are a real human or a piece of code that is trying to access the data
    - Captcha was the old version where you had to type in some squiggle letter
    - Recaptcha is the nwer version where you check a checkbox that say "I'm not a robot"
        - it looks at things like how your mouse approaches the checkbox, how you quiver a little bit before you check the check box, the cookies, the stored data that they have on you etc...

### Is web scraping Ethical
- putting aside what is llegal and what is not, and think about what is right and what is wrong
- if someone has a website and they have some kind of bot that is constantly scraping it for data, data that has been generated by your own users, and that data is really precious and you charge someone else for that data. This may not be illegal but it is ethically wrong

### To help Stay with the llegal and ethical bounds
- always use the public API first, if it requires a application then apply for it, do not just try to take their data when they have already given you a way to access it
- respect the owner of a website, you would not want someone to access your website a million time a second potentially making your website go down, or could count as a DDos attack where it affects other users

## How do I Know?
- when you are on a website they provide you with a way to tell you what it is that you can and cannot scrape
- at the very end of aurl after the `.com` or `.whatever` you can add a forward slash and robots.txt `/robots.txt`
    - try  "https://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt" vs "https://www.linkedin.com/robots.txt"
    - from "https://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt" you will get something like
    ```
    User-Agent: * #this is the person or bot that is scraping
    Crawl-delay: 30 #this is the seconds between each time you scrape, so that you do not add so much demand on the web server it is recommended not to scrape more than once per minute
    Disallow: /collapse? #Disallows means it does not want you to access the endpoint for scraping
    Disallow: /context?
    Disallow: /fave?
    Disallow: /flag?
    Disallow: /hide?
    Disallow: /login
    Disallow: /logout
    Disallow: /r?
    Disallow: /reply?
    Disallow: /submitlink?
    Disallow: /vote?
    Disallow: /x?
```
- the results you get from "https://www.linkedin.com/robots.txt" is massive so it might not be a good idea to scrape theis website at all
