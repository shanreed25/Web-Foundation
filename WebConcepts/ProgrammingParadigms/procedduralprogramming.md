# Procedural programming
- a programming paradigm that focuses on breaking down a program into a sequence of instructions, or procedures, that manipulate data. 
- it emphasizes a step-by-step approach to problem-solving, where the program's logic is expressed as a series of procedures that are executed in a specific order

## Key characteristics of procedural programming: 
- Procedures/Functions:
    - The core building blocks are procedures (also known as functions or subroutines)
    - These are named blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called upon by other parts of the program. 
- Top-down approach:
  - where the problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that are then solved by procedures. 
- Control flow:
  - Control structures like loops and conditional statements are used to direct the flow of execution through the procedures. 
- Data and Procedures:
  - In procedural programming, data and procedures (or functions) are distinct entities. 
  - Data is often passed as arguments to procedures, which then operate on that data. 
- Modularity:
  - by grouping related operations into procedures, making the code more organized and reusable.
