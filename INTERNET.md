# Internet
- Long piece of wire that connects different computers around the world to each other
    - every computer has a IP address, which is like a postal code for your computer
    - there are large undersea cables that connect all the continets on earth, allowing us to connect to computer all over the world
        - these cables consist of hundreds of fiber optic cables that use lasers that transmit up to 400 gigabytes of data per second
        - go to [submarinecablemap.com](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/) to see a map of this
- these computer can talk to each other a transfer data back and forth
- **WEBSERVERS**: some of the computers have to be online 24 hours a day, ready to serve you all the data and files that are needed to access websites
    - serve you all the data and files you need to access websites
- **CLIENTS**: computers that users use to access the internet

# How The Internet works
1. You send a message/request a website, in the browser www.mywebsite.com
    - message says, "I want to see www.mywebsite.com"
2. Your computer/client will send that message/request to your ISP(Internet Service provider)
3. You ISP, will rely the message to a DNS(Domain Name System)
    - DNS: is like aphone book
    - when you make a request through your browser the DNS will look in its database to find the IP address of the website
    - when the IP address is found, it is sent back to your browser through your ISP over the internet
    - then you can make a direct request to that address where the website lives, and get back the data and files you need to view the website

**You can look up the IP address of a website servers by going to [NsLookup.io](https://www.nslookup.io/), you can then paste the IP address into the browser and get the same results as typing the website in the browser**

# Dynamic IP Address
- If a website IP address changes then that website uses Dynamic IP Addresses and a Content Distribution Network(CDN)
- this ensures that it gets you to the closest server to where you are located
- the address will change depending on if it is being used or not
